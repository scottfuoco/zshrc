# ZSHRC Config

This repo contains my .zshrc file, theme and font require to get working correctly.

The font and theme are added to iTerm2 in-order to have the icons appear in the terminal correctly.

They are added under:
Preferences->Profile->Colours
and
Preferences->Profile->Text

## VS Code
In-order to have the same look in the vscode terminal the following need to be added to the User Settings

```json
{
    "terminal.integrated.fontFamily": "Roboto Mono for Powerline",
    "terminal.integrated.fontSize": 12
}
```
